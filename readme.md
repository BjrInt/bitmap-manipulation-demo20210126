# Image manipulation example

Short 20 minutes demo of canvas bitmap manipulation made for Becode learners.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Original</td>
    <td>Transformed</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./forest.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="./transformed.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Want to try something ? 

- Try a color inversion
- Don't draw pixel that are more than half-gray
- Try to randomize the output
- Try to "diff" the forest image and the Danny de Vito image by iterating on both
- Try to find the 5 most used color in this image
- Try to set the background of the page with the most prominent color of the image
